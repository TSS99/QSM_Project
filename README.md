## Project Overview

We implemented **Project 11**, which focuses on specifying two superconducting transmon qubits using the **Qubit Simulation Module (QSM)** and simulating their energy spectrum.

## About QSM

The **Qubit Simulation Module (QSM)** is a software package designed to support the complete design workflow for superconducting qubits and resonators.

It provides a Python-based interface that allows users to:

- Import QSM as a library  
- Create a `qSysLayout` object  
- Pass the `qSysLayout` object into simulations  

---

## Our Implementation

The file **`_initialize_qsm.py_`** serves as the main script for this project. In this script, we:

- Defined the Hamiltonian of the qubit system  
- Performed simulations using QSM  
- Visualized the results  

The visualization includes a graph showing discrete quantum states and their associated energy levels within a bath.

## Results

The simulation produced a graph illustrating:

- Discrete qubit states  
- Corresponding energy levels  

These results provide insights into the physical behavior of the superconducting qubit system.
