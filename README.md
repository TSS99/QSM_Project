# QSM Project
Welcome to the team repository for the Superconducting Quantum Research Program - Chip Design Hackathon 2024. Our team consists of the following members:

Project Overview
We implemented Project 11, which involves specifying two superconducting transmons using the Qubit Simulation Module (QSM) and simulating their energy spectrum.

About QSM
The Qubit Simulation Module (QSM) is a software package designed to facilitate the full design process for superconducting qubits and resonators. It provides a Python-based user interface that allows users to:

Import QSM as a library.
Create a qSysLayout object.
Pass the qSysLayout object into desired simulations.
Our Implementation
The _initialize_qsm.py_ file serves as our main script. In this script, we:

Defined the Hamiltonian of the qubit system.
Simulated the system using QSM.
Visualized the results, which include a graph displaying discrete states and their associated energy levels in a bath.
Results
The simulation produced a graph showing the discrete states of the qubits and their corresponding energy levels, providing insights into the behavior of the system.
